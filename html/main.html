            My journey as a software engineer began in my first year in high school. I grew up in the Florida Keys
            where, at least in 2011, programming was not a common subject to hear or even learn about. One of my
            elective courses was computer science, which at the time all I knew of was 1's and 0's, but I soon realized
            it was much more than that. After that year I had the basic understanding of how computers worked and had
            scraped the surface of how to start coding. The following year I signed up for a web design course where I
            was introduced to HTML/CSS and JavaScript. This is also the year where I discovered about different ways to
            teach myself how to program, beginning with <a class="about-me-link"
              href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/Bloopsah"><u>CodeAcademy</u></a>. From there I was introduced to
            different languages such as
            Python, Ruby, PHP and Java. After finding this new niche I kept trying to teach myself as much as I could,
            but eventually I was unable to go further. I took the remainder of my high school career to focus on
            maintaining my GPA, helping run school clubs, as well as completing my Eagle Scout project.

            My final year of high school I was presented with an opportunity to study abroad as a student ambassador
            through Rotary Youth Exchange. I ended up studying in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden, where I furthered my education in
            web development and physics. Along with my studies I became attended Rotary Club meetings where I
            established several long-lasting connections with the club members, other exchange students, and members of
            the community. Nearing the end of this year I attended a college fair where I learned about Chalmers
            University and the University of Gothenburg. I can still vividly remember the demonstration done by two GU
            students who were experimenting with virtual reality which was still fairly new at the time. I was
            captivated by this and that was the turning point in my life where I decided I wanted to finish my higher
            education in Sweden. I started my bachelor's degree in software engineering and management in 2019, and am
            continuing to pursue it and continue onto a master's degree.
